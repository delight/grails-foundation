What's in Foundation?
---

Foundation is built to help you quickly get a site off the ground and to a state where you can easily adapt and modify it into a release. Here's the highlights:

Global

Foundation's global styles include Eric Meyer's rock-solid reset, tested styles for typography, links, lists, tables and more.

The Grid

Within global.css you'll find The Grid, a layout framework that works on mobile devices, small screens and full-on modern desktops. It's a twelve column, semi-liquid, mobile-scaling grid that supports arbitrary nesting.

Buttons

Foundation includes two base styles, three sizes, and several colors that are preconfigured and easy to modify.

Forms

Foundation provides two base styles for forms that are tested, include validation styles and have proper spacing. It provides custom radio buttons, checkboxes and select lists so you can style up every form element. They're easy to modify.

Orbit

A way to put image or content sliders on your page, is packaged in with Foundation. It even works on mobile.

Reveal

Finally, a whole new plugin for modal dialogs in Foundation. Reveal is easy to call, supports several intro animations right out of the box, and is completely stylable. It also works on mobile.
